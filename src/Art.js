           Jefferson is interested in the intersection of software and art, and
           the possibilities for both generative art and art created by machine learning.
           His work is largely focused on the latter at this point, building off of resources made
           available by Derrick Schultz at his
           site, <a href="https://artificial-images.com/">Artificial Images</a>. He plans on exploring
           procedural generative art, and will be taking classes
           under <a href="https://twitter.com/arsiliath">arsiliath</a>.
           Some of his work is available on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/jlee">OpenSea</a>.
